// This JavaScript function will allow you to click the Extract Provider Info button on the Individual Provider Detail HTML page and then it will call the Extract Provider Info Endpoint.  Note that this is in a different blueprint from the Provider Blueprint so you'll need to be aware of that route difference and then it will display a success message when that completes and then it will refresh the page with the updated information.  @upload_provider_bp.post("/extract_provider_info/<int:provider_id>")
