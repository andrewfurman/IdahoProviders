# WorkQueue · Design & Implementation Guide

## 1  Purpose
The **WorkQueue** module surfaces provider‑data issues (duplicates, missing attributes, validation flags) as actionable work items. Reviewers claim items, inspect the affected provider record, perform corrective actions, and then mark each item *resolved*.  This guide defines database schema, Flask routes, HTML templates, and UX patterns for the first release.
