// This file will be used for JavaScript.  They just need to run the Upload Provider page.  It will specifically have a loading animation for when you click Upload and Extract,  and then it will display that animation while the result is being waited for,  and then it's also going to count up the number of seconds waiting for a response.  So it should say one, two, three,,,, until it gets a response.
